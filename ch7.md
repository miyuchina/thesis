# "But better get used to dreams."

We have been rather focused on a metropolitan Chinese postmodernism:
Wang Shuo, for example, is from Beijing, and Ang Lee, like many Chinese
diasporic artists, lives in New York. Perhaps, then, in a country so
unevenly developed as China, postmodernism might still be limited to the
cities. Indeed, the Nobel laureate 莫言 \[Mo Yan\], publishing his first
works around the same time as Wang Shuo, persistently represents a rural
village in the Chinese northeast that could not look more different from
Beijing. How, then, might Mo Yan's rural literature interact with
Chinese postmodernism?

Mo Yan's most famous work, 红高粱家族 *\[The Red Sorghum Family\]*,
describes the author's hometown, before the founding of the People's
Republic and during the Second World War. Because of this, critics
sometimes characterize it as a Lukáscian historical novel, where a
middle-of-the-way protagonist, standing at the intersection of residual
and emergent historical forces, witnesses the structural changes of a
society.[See, e.g., @kinkley-discomforts] If *The Red Sorghum Family* is a historical novel, however,
it must be a strange historical novel indeed, since the town remains in
virtual stasis despite undergoing the fall of the late Qing Dynasty, the
Japanese invasion, the rule of the puppet government and the influx of
Communist militia. One might even go so far as to claim that to show the
town's socioeconomic stasis is precisely the point of Mo Yan's literary
endeavor, to demonstrate, in other words, how the traditional mode of
Chinese rural existence has a vitality and resilience untouched by
political change. This dynamic between a town embedded in history and a
town outside history---in short, the contradiction between literary
historicism and ahistoricism---is one of the most prominent features of
Mo Yan's fiction, and allows him to jump from the revolutionary period
in *The Red Sorghum Family* to the post-revolutionary period in his
later 蛙 *\[Frog\]*, while maintaining a recognizably consistent image of his
favorite town.

The question, nevertheless, is what the experience of the new and
entrepreneurial China does to the memory of revolutionary China. The
narrator gives an answer in the opening section of the book:

> I used to love the Northeast Gaomi Township with all my heart; I used
> to hate the Northeast Gaomi Township with all my heart. After I had
> grown up and endeavored to learn Marxism, I finally realized: the
> Northeast Gaomi Township is no doubt the most beautiful and the most
> hideous, the most transcendent and the most worldly, the most virgin
> and the most filthy, the most heroic and the most bastardly, the
> hardest-drinking and hardest-loving place on this planet.[^2]

One wonders if the historical materialism of Marxism, which the narrator
claims he "endeavored to learn," has had any impact on his impression of
the Gaomi Township whatsoever.[^3] The shift from before to after a
Marxist education runs parallel to the shift from subjective judgment
("love ... with all my heart ... hate ... with all my heart") to what
sounds like an objective observation ("the Northeast Gaomi Township is
no doubt ..."). But the observation does not turn out, as Marxist
materialism demands, to be the ontological status of material
structures, but instead returns to an aesthetic judgment ("the most
beautiful and the most hideous"). What is preserved from Marxism, then,
is a vertiginous fluctuation between dialectical extremes, from one
superlative to another, so much so that the content of the superlatives
rapidly cancels each other, leaving behind only the formal structure of
the superlative itself: the Northeast Gaomi Township is the site of
superlatives.[^4] Once detached from material referents and operating on
the level of form, the superlatives illuminate in turn that "Marxism,"
here, is in fact a stand-in for the "rupture" or "event" of the Great
Leap Forward or the Cultural Revolution,[^5] during which the narrator
would have received his education. The intensity of the superlatives is
then a blank parody of the high-flown grand narratives of Mao's China,
either of the extravagant political propaganda for increased
agricultural production, or in the revolutionary romanticism, the
Party's ordained literary genre, extolling heroic figures larger than
life.

The realist heritage of Chinese literature, now pushed to the extreme by
Mo Yan, depicts revolutionary heroes in a different light. His
characters not only escape the easy categorization of good versus evil
("the most heroic and the most bastardly"), but also uniformly suffer
from, and demonstrate an almost pathological interest in, the most
extreme forms of violence, bodily mutilation, torture and gore. The
narrator often spends considerable effort describing the exact way that
a bullet enters its victim's eye socket and leaves their skull,
fracturing the entire face. The central motif of the story, the red
sorghum, grows most ferociously in the Township into a "blood ocean,"
and is persistently associated with blood and violence, life and death.
The first time one reads the description of the narrator's father
walking through the sorghum field, one gets the imagery of "three
hundred fellow villagers, their heads pillowed on their arms, their
bodies strewn across the ground, their fresh blood oozing to irrigate
the vast field of sorghum, mudding the soil into black earth that slows
one's walk. The scent of sweetness is suffocating." The most heroic
character, Uncle Arhat, was captured by the Japanese invaders and
managed to escape briefly, crippling two of their mules. He then
receives the goriest description of his death, tied to the rack before
the whole village, castrated and skinned alive---the narrator spares no
graphic details. These extremely faithful descriptions of violence,
then, form a realism in the superlative, a realism in excess.[^6] The
aesthetic experience of reading the novel---watching, for example, the
body of a beloved character being ruthlessly torn apart---is something
like the experience of a Kantian sublime, where the pleasure is
motivated by the pain of comprehending and imagining that which lies
beyond one's cognitive capacity. Mo Yan's fluctuation between
superlatives does make one feel, reeling from the sea of red sorghum
after closing the book, as if one had caught a glimpse of the
incomprehensible: the atrocity of the Japanese invasion, the infinite
vitality of the Gaomi Township, the essence of life and love itself.

It is possible that one recoils from this experience of the sublime,
which breaks with the function of the historical novel altogether.
Contemporary readers, alarmed by the sheer barbarity of bodily violence,
might imagine the Gaomi Township as a place lost in the past, which has
nothing to do with the "socialist new countryside" of the present:
history is no longer relevant, since the material progress of the market
reform has produced a more peaceful, more civilized society. But Mo Yan,
in his typical dialectical fashion, has his narrator pronounce a
Benjaminian sentiment: "With progress, I feel intimately the regression
of our genes." That the present China, despite material progress, is
nevertheless a genetic regression, might be explained by the fact that
post-revolutionary China no longer has the vitality of life, the same
passion for love, as the Gaomi Township in the height of an
anti-imperial war had. But the past is not irrevocable, nor is the
present severed from it, since under the condition of uneven
development, residual forms of Mo Yan's town, in social structures or in
desires and imaginations, still exert influence today. It is by bringing
the vital image of the past back to the present, then, that Mo Yan
commits the most extreme case of violence in his story, which, perhaps
not surprisingly, is a violence against the story itself. The novel
begins with a disturbing dedication:

> With this book I respectfully invoke the heroic, aggrieved souls
> wandering in the boundless bright-red sorghum fields of my hometown.
> As your unfilial son, I am prepared to carve out my heart, marinate it
> in soy sauce, have it minced and placed in three bowls, and lay it out
> as an offering in a field of sorghum. Partake of it in good
> health![^7]

The cannibalistic image doubles its power once the reader realizes that
they are themselves consuming the story, and thereby devouring the
narrator's "heart"---his overflowing emotions, his faithfulness to
depicting the real.[^8] The consumption of literature by contemporary
readers, then, is just as violent an act as the ostensibly bygone era of
barbarism. The violence towards language, a kind of postmodernism
itself, thus generates a dialectical critique of both the consumer
culture of the post-market-reform China, and the superlatives of
revolutionary China. Mo Yan creates a sublime from which one recoils,
but the complacent gesture of recoiling, or retreating into a
"progressive," "civilized" present, becomes just as questionable.

That Mo Yan's works can constitute a postmodernism of the countryside is
surprising, since it lies outside the purview of metropolitan
postmodernism---that this cultural formation should primarily exist in
the economically advanced coastal cities, where it "lands on the Chinese
shores and establishes beachhead positions."[@xudong-postsocialism 407] Even apart from its
realism-to-excess, The *Red Sorghum Family* is an orthodox postmodern
text , since its narration dispenses with linear chronological order and
intercuts multiple moments in the history of the village, a technique
that even its film adaptation---the otherwise privileged artform of an
image society---does not attempt to employ, and which produces a
disorienting effect much like reading Western texts of postmodernism:
"\[W\]e are given unnamed components of an unidentified segment of an
action or a gesture, which must, like magnified fragments of a lost
photograph, be put back together in some recognizable form."[@PM 142] Mo
Yan's fiction, then, does not show that under conditions of economic
uneven development, postmodernism can only exist in cities and not in
the countryside; rather, it serves as a case where a cultural
hermeneutics of uneven development is necessary.

We have previously discussed how the ballpoint pen in Luo Zhongli's
*Father* might be understood as an early glimmer of postmodernism, and
how, probing the hooligans' rhetoric, we are able to piece together the
historical trauma around Zhuo Yue's death. With the notion of an
unevenly developed postmodernism, we might finally be able to solve the
murder mystery behind the headless corpse in *Playing for Thrills*. It
certainly helps, then, that in the last part of the novel, the supposed
victim of the murder, Gao Yang, reemerges in a dream-like scene and
engages in a conversation with Fang Yan. From this point on, the
narration breaks into a reverse-chronological retelling of the
hooligans' younger days in Guangzhou before the murder, and the section
titles count down to the original moment of historical trauma---"Day
Thirteen," "Day Twelve," and so on until "Day One." Even the frame
narrator makes fun of it at the end of the book: "The author appears
reluctant to lay down his pen, wanting to keep at his copious excesses
and take this fellow all the way back to his mother's womb."[@WS 250/324-5]

For this reason, and despite all the suspense the novel generates around
the unidentified corpse, the murder itself is surprisingly easy to
solve. We only need to piece together the relevant plot points: the
victim is not Gao Yang, but rather Feng Xiaogang, who comes to Guangzhou
with borrowed money hoping to make a fortune. The money, however, is
soon lavished by the rest of the hooligans on taxi rides, cigarettes and
alcohol. The get-rich-quick scheme of his, with which he intends to
impress his then romantic partner, Liu Yan, amounts to his own
bankruptcy in the end. As their tour of southern China is running out of
steam, the two Gao brothers and Feng Xiaogang decide to play one last
elaborate prank on the rest of the hooligans, by constructing a murder
mystery that will keep everyone guessing for the years to come. The
murder plot, then, begins as Feng Xiaogang's planned suicide: he
volunteered to serve as the dead body. Fang Yan's identity is stolen by
Feng Xiaogang and Gao Yang, because they choose him to play the
murderer, which prompts the police to come look for him when they
discover the body ten years later. The prank, however, has gone awry
after prolonged arguments among the participants, and Gao Yang kills
Feng Xiaogang by the cliff of a mountain one foggy night. The
altercation between them is never shown; even about the death of Feng
Xiaogang the readers cannot be certain. Instead, we read that "clouds
billowed then spouted and formed a massive human head looking
majestically into the sky, showing the whites of its eyes."[@WS 189/240] This
phantom figure, then, is the decapitated head of Feng Xiaogang returning
"majestically" to haunt the world. His death scene is well-neigh
cataclysmic, "as if the Creator were giving the mortals below a
microcosmic view of the world. The snowcapped mountain crumbled, the
alabaster pillars toppled, tigers and elephants and lions and leopards
were swallowed up by smoke and dust."[@WS 189/240] It is, indeed, the moment of
rupture when the wantonness of the hooligans transgresses into the realm
of the Real: Fang Yan's friend group, after this point, never recovers
its youthful enthusiasm; we find, at the beginning of the novel, a
worn-out and cynical Fang Yan who refuses to believe in anything other
than financial gain or casual sex.

But if the murder of Feng Xiaogang is originally a plan for his suicide,
we have yet to explain how Gao Yang persuades him to be part of this
elaborate murder mystery, how, in other words, his death drive is
generated. Here, then, is Gao Yang's rational for Feng Xiaogang's
suicide:

> You have our word that if the day comes when we never see you again,
> we will tell your story to everybody, whether they knew you or not,
> placing the blame for every unacknowledged misdeed on your head,
> telling how you robbed and plundered, what a playboy you were, and how
> you're now enjoying yourself in a better world. That way you'll become
> a folk hero, a legend embodying all of mankind's longings and
> fantasies ... You have our word that for the next ten years you'll
> live in the people's hearts. After that, it's out of our hands. You
> know how hard it is for our great revolutionary pioneers to live for
> more than ten years in the people's hearts, so you have nothing to
> complain about. Ten years is damned close to immortality, so you can
> reside down in the Nine Springs with a smile on your face.[@WS 179-180/227]

We know that, when Fang Yan gets the visit from the police, it has been
roughly ten years since Feng Xiaogang's death, which means that Feng
Xiaogang is indeed immortalized. But when Wang Shuo first published the
novel in 1987, it has also been nearly ten years since the beginning of
the market reform. The way Feng Xiaogang is immortalized, further, is
through narratives. Gao Yang's soliloquy, in this sense, is a catalogue
of the narrative forms available in the Chinese culture during the first
decade of the market reform. Feng Xiaogang is to "become a folk hero,"
residing "down in the Nine Springs" and "enjoying \[himself\] in a
better world." If he is to be the protagonist of a folk legend
"embodying all of mankind's longings and fantasies," though, the myth of
his death will become the missing cultural origin that the root-seeking
movement in the early 1980s desperately look for. Different from the
stoic traditionalism of the root-seeking movement, however, the
hooligans are going to describe Feng Xiaogang as the rogue anti-hero,
"telling how \[he\] robbed and plundered," ambiguous as to whether he is
a benevolent knight-errant figure from the martial arts genre or the
evil mastermind in a crime fiction. But when it comes to living "in
people's hearts" for the next decade, and out-performing the lifespan of
"our great revolutionary pioneers," Gao Yang is speaking in yet another
register---the recognizable rhetoric of the Cultural Revolution. One
would also note that performing one's death as revolutionary martyrdom
is the favorite game of the hooligans in their childhood: "Some of us
were killers, the others were the police ... Torture lay in store for
the killers when they were caught, and still we all fought to be the
killers, because ... after they were caught, they could put on a real
show. They were the stars, the ones who made the game."[@WS 136/174] Feng
Xiaogang's death drive is therefore also a desire to restage a sacrifice
for the revolution in an age when the revolution no longer exists. This,
then, is the meaning of the novel's title, *Playing for Thrills*, which
Feng Xiaogang uses, earlier in this scene, to justify his wish for
suicide:[^16] the thrills that come with the hooligan's play, at this
point of their trajectory, is the vital and subversive energy of their
revolutionary heritage.

But Feng Xiaogang dies a nameless death, and never gets to reenact any
martyrdom of his fantasies. It seems, further, that Gao Yang no longer
believes in the narratives that he invokes himself. The image of "our
great revolutionary pioneers" only serves to excite Feng Xiaogang, but
Gao Yang speaks in thoroughgoing irony. For Gao Yang the murderer, then,
the revolution has already transpired, and the historical trauma is in
an even earlier moment, for which the cataclysmic death of Feng Xiaogang
is only the reverberation. This original moment of trauma,
appropriately, occurs on Day One, the last to be recounted in the
reverse-chronological sequence:

> "Ignore them," Gao Yang said to Gao Jin. "They've got their heads in
> the clouds. Give them a couple of days here, and just watch them
> change. What good is money? Lots of good. There are two kinds of
> people who don't know the value of money: Those who are born with it
> and those who have never tasted its joys. Pretending you're
> high-principled nobility is stupid. Where will you find China's
> nobility? They're in power now, but thirty years ago they were a bunch
> of cowherds. Close down the national treasury, and they'll all be out
> on the streets begging."[@WS 248/322]

Here, not only Feng Xiaogang's head is in the clouds; all the rest of
the hooligans, apart from the Gao brothers, are, which implies that Feng
Xiaogang's death is due to his anachronistic revolutionary idealism.
Anyone who has high principles is stupid; the new era calls for
political realism. "China's nobility," "a bunch of cowherds" "thirty
years ago" but now the ruling class, refers to the first-generation
revolutionaries, the parents of the hooligans, who, Gao Yang suggests,
are merely feeding off of "the national treasury." The privatization of
national industries during the first decade of the market reform,
indeed, destroys the stable career of many members of the Party
bureaucracy. The hooligans, in effect, have been thrown onto the streets
by the market reform---Fang Yan's gang arrives in Guangzhou with
borrowed money, swindling and stealing their way into hotels and
restaurants. The trauma of the hooligans in postmodernism, then, is
brought about by capitalism: "What good is money? Lots of good." It is
only appropriate that Gao Yang's capitalist manifesto is followed by the
image of an apocalypse, flames blazing against the immaculate surface of
a postmodern skyscraper, a reenactment or prefiguration of a revolution:

> The high-rise was now a towering inferno, an enormous pine-bright
> torch. In the radiant sunlight the flames were the reddest of reds. A
> crowd has formed in front of the building; fire crews threw up
> ladders; silvery jets of water arched toward the rooftop; firemen's
> helmets glinted in the sun. Water sprayed everywhere, glittery and
> crystalline, frames leaped into the red and the black sky, burning
> fiercely, a wanton display of might high up; rooftops, some flat,
> others tapered, were bathed in serenely stupefying sunbeams.[@WS 249/323]
