In subsequent chapters, I hope to employ, as a theoretical practice, the
concept of postmodernism to the case of Chinese literature.  By
"postmodernism," I refer to the widely influential framework proposed by
Fredric Jameson, who defined the term as "the cultural logic of late
capitalism." In an alternative version of this essay, I would, as an expectant
reader will rightly demand, launch rather straightforwardly into a discussion
of Chinese postmodernism itself, to see, in other words, whether the theory of
postmodernism apply or does not apply to the Chinese context. For better or
worse, this is not the approach taken here. I fear that the invocation of a
Jamesonian postmodernism has already raised alarm bells of various kinds, and
the seemingly innocuous proposal that it is possible at all to transplant a
Western theory of postmodernity and "apply" it, regardless of my conclusion to
support or renounce Jameson's framework, is deeply suspect. In simpler terms, I
feel guilty resuscitating the much maligned term, "postmodernism," especially
in view of the unfortunate theoretical disagreement which inspired the creation
of its disciplinary other, under the almost equally contentious heading,
"postcolonialism." This prologue, an apology to my readers as much as a
self-diagnosis of my guilt, seeks to explain the role of "postmodernism" in my
project.

The selection of Gayatri Spivak as what can only be called an emblem of
Jameson's postcolonial critics is not an accident. Postcolonial theory is
a vast and self-different field, and to posit Spivak as somehow unifying
the most common list of authors cited by Jameson's critics---Edward Said,
Homi Bhabha, Aijaz Ahmad, and certainly Spivak herself---is as mistaken as
to posit the entire field of postcolonialism as against postmodernism as
such. My sense, nevertheless, is that Spivak's critique of Jameson gets at
some of the most fundamental contradictions of postmodernism, which offers
a few guiding threads from which a host of related objections can be
extrapolated. This is, of course, due to the highly Derridean qualities of
Spivak's writing: self-referential and self-critical in the way that Paul
de Man attributes to theory in *The Resistance to Theory*, namely, that
theory is its own resistance; and a polyglossia, where multiple strands of
argumentation are interwoven in an increasingly elaborate dance of
critical appraisal, unraveling and self-interrupting at the same time. One
can read into Spivak, as I will attempt briefly to do below, the grounds
of more targeted postcolonial critiques against Jameson, by virtue of her
deconstructive practice.

One can also suggest, nevertheless, that I am setting up a debate where
Jameson will automatically win, as is already evident in the phrase "the
cultural logic of late capitalism" itself. For the definition of
postmodernism is, if not the synthesis, then at least the conjoining of
its two constitutive terms, "cultural logic," of which Jameson names
poststructuralism as one of its most prominent ideologies, and "late
capitalism," which refers, not to the "end of history" in the sense of
Francis Fukuyama, but rather to something like "capitalism *of late,*" and
which Jameson variously revised to "postindustrial society," "image
society," or "multinational capitalism" [-@PM xviii]. It is easy to
sense the Althusserian schema in the positioning of these terms: "late
capitalism," or the material base, versus its "cultural logic," or the
ideological superstructure. Even in a properly dialectical relation
between base and superstructure, where "the interrelationship of culture
and the economic ... is not a one-way street but a continuous reciprocal
interaction and feedback loop," poststructuralism will nevertheless be
treated as an ideology, a symptom rather than its cause, to be
outflanked and, indeed, *aufgehoben*, by the dialectician himself. [@PM
xiv-xv] To stage Spivak's deconstruction against Jameson's Marxism,
then, amounts to an act of "foreclosure," the term Spivak uses when,
earlier in the book, she deconstructs Kantian, Hegelian or Marxist
theory, so that she may reveal how these theoretical systems silence the
different possibilities that an undialecticized playing field might
offer.

I intend to do none of the foreclosing, which says very little. I will
admit, however, that in the context of this prologue, my reading of Spivak
will be a misreading of Spivak, just as my reading of Jameson is
a misreading of Jameson. I take this to be in accordance with Spivak's
own acknowledgment that her reading of Kant is "mistaken" [-@spivak 9].
Spivak considers this misreading a strategic intervention, what she
calls "a scrupulous travesty in the interest of producing
a counternarrative that will make visible the foreclosure of the subject
whose lack of access to the position of narrator is the condition of
possibility of the consolidation of Kant's position" [-@spivak 9]. The
foreclosure here is, among other things, the silencing of the subject
position of what Spivak calls the "native informant," which might be
more broadly construed as the colonial subject, to which Spivak herself
belongs.[^1] My misreading of Spivak and Jameson, then, is an
intervention in their mutual foreclosure---an effort to demonstrate, in
other words, how Jameson is under erasure in Spivak, and Spivak is under
erasure in Jameson.

How is Jameson, then, foreclosing the colonial subject? Spivak identifies
this, first, in Jameson's use of the word, "we." The question, for Spivak,
is to whom this first-person collective refer, and interrogation of which
reveals Jameson's own limited and, relatively speaking, privileged subject
position: "distinguished U.S. professor of the humanities with
a considerable radical reputation commenting on the postmodern cultural
dominant" [-@spivak 313]. One implied critique, then, might suggest that
such an elite position has no right of theorizing for everyone, or
generalize a theoretical position so that it may apply to everywhere,
regardless of their drastically different positions in the world.
Spivak's critique, however, goes further to claim that Jameson's use of
"we" robs the colonial subject the possibility of voicing their own
theory within Jameson's rhetoric, so that all readers become the
homogeneous "we" of the privileged critic of United States. In Spivak's
words: "For Jameson's text to make sense, the reader must fill
a subject-position referring at least to State, Institutional,
Hero-ritual, construction of the object of investigation" [-@spivak
313]. For postcolonial theorists conscious of the power positions that
comes with the assumption of the subject, it is easy to feel alienated
from this "we."

A certain version of this alienation happens, indeed, when Aijaz Ahmad
formulates his critique of Jameson's essay, "Third-World Literature in the
Era of Multinational Capitalism." When Jameson argues that all third-world
literature are national allegories, Ahmad, "born in India ... and
a Pakistani citizen ... realized with no little chagrin, that the man whom
I had for so long, so affectionately, even though from a physical
distance, taken as a comrade was, in his own opinion, my civilizational
Other" [-@ahmad 4]. In this case, Jameson's "object of investigation"
casts Ahmad as the "civilizational Other," and makes it possible for
Jameson to theorize in the latter's stead. This, then, is what prompts
the colonial subjects' anxiety of his own erasure: "I said to myself,
'*All?... necessarily?*' It felt odd" [@ahmad 4]. Spivak's final
critique, based on her previous evaluation of Western philosophic
frameworks, is that the construction of such general concepts or
"cultural dominants" depends on the erasure of the colonial subject. In
view of my future discussion of Chinese literature, Jameson's
speaking-for the colonial subject seems particularly pertinent, since it
has often been observed that there had been no ostensible "postmodern"
culture in China before Jameson gave his lecture series on postmodernism
in Peking University in
1985. The history of postmodernism in China does seem, at least at
first, to have at its origin a performative use of language: the
speaking of postmodernism brings it into being.

In retrospect, then, despite Jameson's multiple subsequent attempts to
rescue the usefulness of his essay on "Third-World Literature," the
characterization of "*all*... *necessarily*" still seems like a misstep.
If anything, this attempt to assign homogeneity to so nebulous a term as
"third-world literature" contradicts his own conception of the "cultural
dominant," and it is here that I attempt to evaluate how Spivak appears to
foreclose Jameson. In his essay on postmodernism, Jameson argues that the
"cultural dominant" can still account for the fact that there are
alternative cultures in the present world. He notes, "I am very far from
feeling that all cultural production today is 'postmodern' in the broad
sense I will be conferring on this term. The postmodern is however the
force field in which very different kinds of cultural impulses---what
Raymond Williams has usefully termed 'residual' and 'emergent' forms of
cultural production---must make their way" [-@PM 6]. This proviso can be
read as a preemptive counterargument to the claim, also available in
Spivak, that Jameson merely theorized the cultural logic of New York,
Los Angeles, London, Paris, Tokyo, and even perhaps Shanghai and Hong
Kong, that postmodernism remains a theory of the Euro-American
metropolises, but certainly not of elsewhere---Africa, India, perhaps,
or the majority of inland China. Revising the term "cultural dominant"
through Raymond Williams, then, allows Jameson to say that the
differences in cultural production can nevertheless be mapped along the
axis of the residual and the emergent, while retaining postmodernism as
the overarching paradigm. It might also afford the speculation that,
once all the world does attain the homogeneity of the Western
metropolis, postmodernism as a cultural paradigm must have already
become the residual form within a new, emergent one, just as the
institutionalization of modernism, in Jameson's account, ushers in the
era of postmodernism. Within each historical period, then, there exists
what Marxists call the "uneven development," not only in the material
base, where different modes of production---merchant, industrial and
finance capitalism in our current era---coexist, but also in the
superstructure, where different modes of cultural (re)production may be
characterized as residual or emergent.

Granted, it is not altogether clear how much centrality Jameson is willing
to assign these differences. The Marxist term, "uneven development," is
certainly available to him and attributed to postmodernism, since he notes
that "there is a deeper reason for the disappearance of the Great Writer
under postmodernism, and it is simply this, sometimes called 'uneven
development'" [-@PM 307].[^2] When he argues that "\[m\]odernism must
thus bee seen as a uniquely corresponding to an uneven moment of social
development, or to what Ernst Bloch called the 'simultaneity of the
nonsimultaneous, the 'synchronicity of the nonsynchronous,'" then, he is
noting that modernism is a "moment" within the historical timeline of
uneven development, where postmodernism can conceivably be another.
[-@PM 307] But it seems elsewhere that Jameson is interested in
theorizing the "sheer heteronomy" of postmodernism as mere phenomena,
whose appearance of "uneven development" or "nonsynchronocity" should
rather be treated as a reified "ideology of difference" [-@PM 342].
Where Lukács announces that "\[t\]he commodity can only be understood in
its undistorted essence when it becomes the universal category of
society as a whole," Jameson argues here that postmodernism can only be
grasped when the theoretical discourse of difference becomes
institutionalized and reproduced by the society as a whole. [-@lukacs
86] This, then, is perhaps what prompts him to say: "Ours is a more
homogeneously modernized condition; we no longer are encumbered with the
embarassment of non-simultaneities and non-synchronicities" [-@PM 310].
It does seem that Jameson, by "\[naming\] the system," is trying to
promote a unified class consciousness against the "ideology of
difference": "If we do not achieve some general sense of a cultural
dominant, then we fall back into a view of present history as sheer
heterogeneity, random difference, a coexistence of a host of distinct
forces whose effectivity is undecidable" [-@PM 6].

It would be misguided to accuse Jameson of contradiction, since, for
a dialectical thinker, contradictions are the means through which reason
gains its self-realization. The discussion of postmodernity as homogeneous
and synchronic, or heterogeneous and non-synchronic, is in this sense
a reenactment of the old Hegelian contradiction between identity and
difference, where each term can only be understood in relation to the
other. One can still worry, of course, whether Jameson is rather
heavy-handed with assimilating difference into identity, and relatively
inconsiderate of how identity might self-fragment into difference. I take
Spivak's objection, namely, that "\[i\]t is not immediately clear why
these \[sheer heterogenity, random difference, undecidable forces\] are
the only alternatives open to a cultural critic," as on some level
highlighting the emancipatory potentials within these "pre-emergent"
differences. [-@spivak 314] It is at least conceivable, even within
a Marxist framework, that the dominant mode of production and its
Lukácsian "veil of reification" can be broken apart by the
contradictions among its heterogeneities. The theory of uneven
development, indeed, makes Trotsky's conception of an "ongoing
revolution" possible, where the struggle against capitalism can be
fought on a much more extended front. After all, Jameson, insofar as one
considers his theory emancipatory, can hardly be said to occupy anything
more than a particularly prominent strand among the non-synchronic
pre-emergence.

It therefore seems to me important that the theory of uneven development
be brought to the center stage in an attempt to read Jameson after Spivak.
If uneven development characterizes the radically different levels of
modernization during modernity, it would be rather odd if it does not
characterize the radically different levels of globalization during
postmodernity. Indeed, the imperialist world order in the guise of global
capitalism depends on such uneven development for exploitation: in the
economic realm, through the global division of labor, where industrial
capitalism clusters in the so-called "developing countries"; in the
cultural realm, through processes such as cultural appropriation, or more
sophisticated systems such as Pascale Casanova's "world republic of
letters."

I will note, further, that China seems to be the locus of such issues of
uneven development during its postmodernity, not least because, when
Jameson introduced the term "postmodernism," China is barely a decade into
its market reform. However one decides to characterize Chinese
postmodernity, then, one has to confront the coexistence of residual
socialist economic formations and emergent, capitalist ones, which still
says nothing yet of the distinctness of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, or of
the category of the Chinese diaspora. These considerations are equally
pertinent today, when, just as the facade of the Bonaventure Hotel
reflects the bewildering complexity of the urban space around it, China
seems to contain within itself all the unevenness and contradictions that
globalization has to offer: it is as much an imperial power (colonizing,
say, the Uyghurs in Xinjiang or large portions of Africa) as it is
a victim of colonization, as much a "first-world country" with shining
metropolises as a "third-world country" with semi-urbanized countrysides.

I do not intend, then, to become the Chinese version of Spivak's "native
informant," whose status in Spivak's argument is something like the
unspoken and unspoken-for category of the subaltern, always under erasure.
I am no longer the subaltern insofar as I am speaking, and to say that
I am a "native" informant is in any case to ignore my academic training in
a privileged U.S. liberal arts college. Neither do I want to assign any
semblance of essentialism to the "Chinese characteristics," even in the
mode approvingly attributed to Spivak, the so-called "strategic
essentialism," if only in view of the violence the phrase "socialism with
Chinese characteristics" has done to the concept of socialism. Chinese
postmodernism, if there is such a thing, would, returning to my discussion
above, be a "cultural logic of uneven development," a proviso that,
I hope, offers a useful intervention for the ongoing debate between
postmodernism and postcolonialism, indeed, for the self-difference of
Jameson's framework of postmodernism itself.

To reconsider Spivak's most general critique of Jameson, then, that the
unifying framework of postmodernism reveals his "desire to keep
heterogeneity at bay," I could be coy and argue that whether
heterogeneity is actually kept at bay can only be determined in my
theoretical practice which follows---except, of course, Spivak will
demonstrate that this practice will already be determined by a unifying
logic suspiciously presumed *a priori*, by the mechanisms of the
Jamesonian political unconscious. [-@spivak 314] I am, unfortunately,
not Jameson, and ultimately cannot speak to whether he willfully
forecloses colonial subjects or not. But Spivak's objection sometimes
appears to be levied against the methodology of the dialectic itself,
and especially against the ready synthesis that a Marxian teleology
seems to offer. Jameson, however, does not provide ready synthesis of
this sort. His theory of postmodernism, just like his proposed
resolution for postmodernism, namely, cognitive mapping, is an attempt
at a representation \[*Darstellung*\][^3] of something that does not
exist,[^4] what Walter Benjamin will call a constellation.[^5] Jameson's
project, "totalizing" or "cognitively mapping," should be read as
a process and not a conclusion: "Indeed, if the word *totality*
sometimes seems to suggest that some privileged bird's eye view of the
whole is available, which is also the Truth, then the project of
totalization implies exactly the opposite and takes as its premise the
impossibility for individual and biological human subjects to conceive
of such a position" [-@PM 332]. I do not want to imply, since this
section of my narrative has come to a close, that the result of the
debate between Jameson and Spivak is henceforth decided, and I can
employ the term "postmodernism" without interrogating its implications.
The owl of Minerva which inspires my project also informs me that
postmodernity can only be theorized after the fact. This is also why
I begin, not with an "introduction" to postmodernism or Chinese
postmodernism, but a prologue of what is to come. What is to come is an
experiment in Jamesonian totalization, or, if you prefer,
a *Darstellung* of something different indeed.

[^1]: The difference between Spivak's "native informant" and "colonial
  subject" might be understood in terms of the difference between "a
  member of subaltern groups" and their insertion "into the long road to
  hegemony," or, when they are gradually integrated into institutions and
  allowed to speak. Spivak identifies this as a "trace-structure
  (effacement in disclosure)" [-@spivak 310].

[^2]: This is perhaps a good opportunity to point out that Spivak is
  writing only in direct response to Jameson's earlier article on
  postmodernism in the *New Left Review*, which later becomes the first
  chapter of *Postmodernism.* In a footnote, Spivak argues that "\[the
  article's\] presuppositions are elaborated, not contradicted, in the
  book" [-@spivak 312]. As my citations from Jameson's aptly named
  "Secondary Elaborations" suggest, I do not share Spivak's confidence,
  the word "elaboration" altogether too close to the dangerous Derridean
  concept of "repetition."

[^3]: "This perspective \[of narrative\] may be reformulated in terms of
  the traditional dialectical code as the study of *Darstellung*: that
  untranslatable designation in which the current problems of
  *representation* productively intersect with the quite different ones of
  *presentation*, or of the essentially narrative and rhetorical movement
  of language and writing through time." [@PU 13]

  \[cognitive mapping\] about which I know nothing whatsoever, except for
  the fact that *it does not exist*" [@CM 347\; emphasis added].

[^5]: "The answer to \[how ideas are related to phenomena\] is: in the
