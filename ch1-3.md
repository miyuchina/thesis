In Wang Shuo's fiction, uneven development functions as a constitutive
force, bridging mass consumerism and elite bourgeois culture to produce
the unique style of hooliganism. In Mo Yan's fiction, similarly, uneven
development brings back a history so vibrant that one wants nothing more
than to reenact it in the present and abandon it in the past at the same
time. But conditions of uneven development also exists between the two
narratives, between metropolitan and rural culture, which cannot be
explained if postmodernism only exists in local "enclaves" and is not
embedded within a common, national socioeconomic structure. It is
further striking that the moment when both authors critique the
socioeconomic structure as a whole---socialism as well as
capitalism---is also the moment when the narratives become
self-reflexive, calling attention to the textuality of the narratives
themselves---through sign-substitutions of Wang Shuo, through the
superlative realism of Mo Yan. When these texts come closest to
explicating the "collective 'meaning' of history," or what Jameson might
call the deepest, "anagogical level" of their allegorical function, they
also come closest to reverting back to the most surface, "literal level"
of textuality or language as such. [@PU 31] This collapsing of Jameson's
four allegorical levels of interpretation, the anagogical depth
returning to the literal surface, might be a corollary to the sense of
depthlessness one feels in postmodernism, entangled in the rapturous
dance of signifiers and incapable of discerning the social structure
within.

These unexplained commonalities between two otherwise distinct local
postmodernisms, then, make Arif Dirlik's concept of postsocialism
immediately attractive. Its analogue in the cultural realm most
resembles "root-seeking literature 寻根文学," a literary trend in the
mid- to late-1980s that explores the interactions between the nation's
socialist heritage and its latest capitalist influx. The young
intellectuals of the time, growing up during the social turmoil of the
Cultural Revolution, feel that the failed socialist experiment disrupts
the "origin" or "root" of culture, which a market economy does little to
remedy. These concerns equally plague the protagonists of Ah Cheng's
1984 novella, "The Chess King 棋王," widely considered to be the source
text (the "root") of the "root-seeking" movement. I hope to show,
nonetheless, that the much sought-after "root" is more complicated than
one might expect. Indeed, what constitutes as a "root" or "cultural
origin" is the central problematic of "The Chess King" itself.

An early commentator of the novella observes that, despite being set
during the height of the Cultural Revolution, "one of the most
surprising things about it is the almost complete absence of plot
elements dealing with the abuses so widely suffered during the period"
[@huters 391]. This is horribly mistaken, but in an indicative way: plot
elements of the Cultural Revolution is everywhere in the story, but
everywhere repressed. The repression is immediately obvious in the
beginning section of the novella, when the narrator explains laconically
why he decides to be sent down to the countryside:

> I have seen the couple of friends of mine off to the countryside. Now
> it's my turn; no one's here to see me off. My parents had quite a few
> stains on their record, and died soon after the Revolution started.
> The furniture all had aluminum labels with government numbers on them,
> and were therefore all confiscated, which was quite reasonable. I was
> alone, but did not count as the only child, and could not stay in the
> city according to the policy. I wandered like a wild wolf for over
> a year; finally I decided to leave.

\noindent
What is different about "The Chess King" from the previous two
narratives, first, is that this one begins with a scene of migration:
first in the train station and subsequently on the train. The narrator
is migrating both spatially---from the city to the countryside---and in
terms of social hierarchy: the "stains" of his parents during the
Cultural Revolution are usually either problems of political allegiance
among government officials, or simply being wealthy, implying, in either
case, high social standing. The narrator is thus uprooted from the
security of life and forced to "wander like a wild wolf," since all the
furniture are confiscated ("which was quite reasonable"). The reader
later learns that he lived for nearly two years on the edge of
starvation, getting meals from sympathetic friends or eating leftover
breadcrumbs. It therefore seems that if the experience of "socialism,"
the Cultural Revolution, is the "root" of the story, then it functions
as a trauma repressed beneath the level of the text, displaced through
euphemisms and foreshortened descriptions.

On the train, the narrator soon encounters a similarly destitute young
man, Wang Yisheng, and a sense of camaraderie, because of their shared
trauma, begins to develop between the two. But the story, tracing how
Wang Yisheng becomes the Chess King, seems to foreground a different
kind of cultural origin, a "root" that is older than what a socialist
commune might offer. To grasp this alternative conception of the "root,"
it is important to remember that playing Chinese chess is itself an
allegory of political engagement, a Confucian gesture of
going-into-the-world, the chessboard symbolically a map of China. Wang
Yisheng, opening up to the narrator, tells the story of how he learns to
play chess from a genius old scavenger, who seems to have bequeathed
Wang the Daoist classic, *Tao Te Ching*.[^1] When Wang asks why, if the
old man is so unbelievably talented at chess, he picks trash for
a living and does not attempt to change the world, the Daoist scavenger
replies:

> The chess has only this many pieces; the chessboard is only this
> large. Every match is the same Way [Dao 道], only with different
> forces [Shi 势]. But you can see all the pieces with your eyes. Too
> much is unknown in the world. All the new posters everyday---you might
> see some traces of the Way, but can never know the bottom of it.
> Without all the pieces, there is no playing chess.

\noindent
Wang Yisheng's chessboard, one realizes, is where different strands of
ancient Chinese philosophy play out, and thus the Chess King's fanatic
pursuit of perfecting his chess skills represent a desire to return to
a Chinese traditional culture. This is a "root" severed by the Cultural
Revolution: whatever book the scavenger gave to Wang, it was seized by
the revolutionaries and destroyed on the spot, which only adds to the
mystic allure of the book---the fabled key to the Way of chess, which
Wang Yisheng memorized anyways. But as soon as the idea of a "root" is
proposed, it is multiplied. The old man's description of the chess is
already overlaying Daoism over against its implicit Confucianism. During
the Cultural Revolution, when the primary form of political engagement
is too often violent and riotous, the decision to pursue a Daoism would
be understandable, except that a proper understanding of Daoism also
means that the scavenger is rejecting political engagement for the wrong
reason: the Daoist imperative, oversimply, is to understand how the Way
might govern and manifest itself within the world's multitudes; knowing
the Way, then, there is no point in changing it, since it is the
fundamental principle of all things. But the scavenger claims that
"[t]oo much is unknown in the world," which sounds like a defeated
Daoism, an idealist philosophy that has given up on finding the Way. If
the Way is the "root" of Daoism, it is also lost in the rhetorics of the
Cultural Revolution ("All the new posters everyday---you ... can never
know the bottom of it").

The Chess King, in any case, does not seem fully taken by Daoism. His
latent Confucianism can be seen when a fellow chess enthusiast, in awe
of Wang's talent, exclaims, "The world is yours!," to which Wang,
quietly assenting, says humbly, "I learned chess from the world." The
political allegory of the chess game becomes overt when the narrator,
witnessing Wang Yisheng playing blind chess simultaneously against the
top nine chess contestants at a local sports meet, is moved to write:

> I feel surging upwards from my heart something ancient, my throat
> tightening from its flow. The books I have read, some are nearer, some
> farther, blurrier. The Liu Bang and Xiang Yu whom I otherwise admire
> now gape in wonder; the bodies of those dark-faced soldiers rise up
> from the soil and, their voices hoarse, slowly begin to move.

\noindent
Wang Yisheng, by playing chess, does seem to be symbolically changing
the world. But he nevertheless does so differently from what
Confucianism would recommend, that he become a famous politician like
Liu Bang or a heroic military strategist like Xiang Yu.[^2] Nor is he
a "king" in any sense of the word, as his nickname would otherwise
imply. Rather, the narrator describes Wang Yisheng to have brought back
to life "the bodies of those dark-faced soldiers," who, forgotten in
time and "their voices hoarse," make the great men of history stand
gaping in wonder. The imagery of a zombie apocalypse, indeed, seem to
subvert both traditional Chinese historiography, which only records
world-historical individuals, and symbolically the entire feudal
structure, where the all-powerful king rules over his nameless subjects.
Wang's chess play invites something like a populist revolution, for
which there is again a historical referent: Mao's peasant revolution
("rise up from the soil") that led to the founding of the People's
Republic. The "root" of traditional culture, already doubled over by the
contradictory combination of Daoism and Confucianism, now turns out to
be the very ideology that seeks to eradicate tradition in the first
place: this time, a genuine revolutionary socialism, a culture from the
grassroots.

If Dirlik's term "postsocialism" identifies the ambiguous relationship
a post-market-reform China has towards its socialist era, one can now
say, with further clarity, the form that this ambiguity takes. The
"root" in "root-seeking literature," as evident in its source text, does
not designate a stable or isolated origin, but is rather a multiply
constituted structure, combining, anachronistically, socialism and
feudalism, Confucianism and Daoism at the same time.[^3] Such a "root,"
then, is no longer a root but instead a rhizome, a network without
a center and with only lines of flight. The network, in turn, structures
the trauma and desires of all who is enmeshed within a postsocialist
society: the narrator traumatized by the Cultural Revolution, the Chess
King desiring traditional culture.

But Ah Cheng's novella, early as it is, does not discuss the most
powerful structuring force of individual desires, namely, capitalism
itself. To understand how traditionalism, socialism and capitalism
coherently structure one's desires, it is worth returning to Wang Shuo
and examine his most famous work, "Animal Ferocious 动物凶猛."[^4] The
novella has attracted the English-speaking academia's attention most
prominently because of a passage, about two-thirds of the way into the
narrative, that announces the falsity of the narrative itself, and
acknowledges the futility of reconstructing a faithful image of the
past. I have discussed the self-reflexivity of Wang Shuo's fiction
previously in "Wan Zhu," characteristic of his postmodernism. But
"Animal Ferocious" is special even among Wang Shuo's own works, because
it is a coming-of-age story of the hooligans during the Cultural
Revolution. A thirty-year-old narrator, writing from the present day,
recounts in a melancholic tone an unrequited love when he was fifteen.
The story, then, is also the narrator seeking his own roots, by
reminiscing about his identity-forming encounter with desire. Indeed,
the Chinese character for "root 根," like the English word, preserves in
slang usage the meaning "the male genitalia."

Perhaps not surprisingly, socialism, which figures primarily as trauma
in Ah Cheng's story, signifies career prospects and political
aspirations for Wang Shuo's privileged narrator, whose father is
a military official of the PLA. But the desire for socialism undergoes
a profound change when the narrator, secretly bringing his love interest
Ning Jing back home, inadvertently runs into his father, who scolds him
and tells him to go to bed. The narrator plans to sneak out and find
Ning Jing again, so he pretends to fall asleep, but his mind runs wild:

> I thought for a good while in bed how to lead my troops into battle
> with the Soviet mechanized infantry on the plains, how to destroy
> tanks, how to shoot down airplanes, how to seize the opportunity to
> send in the reserve formation and begin a strategic counter-assault.
> Of course my thoughts never betrayed Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of
> the People's War, although even then I was skeptical as to whether
> tunnels or landmines can be as useful against the Japanese as they are
> today ...
>
> And then, I climbed over the window and jumped outside.

\noindent
It is glaringly obvious how masturbatory the narrator's imagination is,
since, in substitute for his love interest, he is fantasizing about an
all-out war between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic. The
narrator's phallic power is on full display in the battle scene,
smashing tanks and taking down airplanes. The attending circumstance of
this fantasy, further, forms a Oedipal structure, since it is the father
figure who forbids the son from pursuing an erotic prospect, which is
further reproduced in the antagonism between the Soviet Union and China,
the "father" and "son" of really existing socialism. But the Oedipal
structure is complicated by the fact that the name of the father, for
the narrator, is socialism itself, because the kind of war hero that he
wants to be is exactly what his father, a current military official,
represents. Socialism-as-father, then, becomes the symbolic order that
at once structures the narrator's desire and denies its true
fulfillment.

Even more peculiar, however, is how the narrator describes the woman of
his desire. Below, in sequential order, are three of the most
significant descriptions of Ning Jing:

> She looks taller than her photo. When we all stood up again,
> I confirmed my impression of her: plump, rosier, built like a white
> woman.
>
> Her chignon, stray hair dangling over her forehead, makes her look all
> anew, displaying a charm completely different from all the young
> modern woman, as if comparing Song-dynasty china to glass containers.
>
> Now I see her, hopping over to the gate with a stride, her right arm
> aloft like the goddess statues commonly seen in the port cities of
> Europe or America.

\noindent
The second description, comparing Ning Jing to Song-dynasty china,
evokes traditional Chinese culture as a structuring force of the
narrator's desire, much like Wang Yisheng's fanatic love for chess in
"The Chess King." The readers also learnt, earlier on, that Ning Jing's
family hangs a silk embroidery of the West Lake, which further assigns
Ning Jing traditional beauty: the West Lake is the most famous
attraction of Hangzhou, which was the capital city of China during the
late Song dynasty.[^5] But the first and third descriptions almost frame
Ning Jing as the narrator's ethnical other, "like a white woman."
Indeed, in the third example, the narrator not only forgets the name of
the Statue of Liberty, but also seems ignorant that it is the landmark
of New York City, but not anywhere else. It is impossible that Wang Shuo
forgets the name of the Statue: the novella was written in 1991, and
students in the Tiananmen Massacre, two years prior, erected a Statue
of Liberty in front of Mao's portrait on Tiananmen Square. The Statue,
furthermore, is said to be "commonly seen in the port cities of Europe
and America," which disperses its specificity to New York City and
transforms it into a generalized symbol of liberal capitalism. When the
narrator covets Ning Jing, then, he is in fact positioning his desire
within the triad structure of traditionalism, socialism and capitalism,
which, overdetermining each other, forms a symbolic order for the
cultural imaginary of the post-market-reform China. The search for one's
cultural "roots," finally, yields the surprising result that capitalism,
too, is a source of Chinese culture, a civilizational other [*autre*]
more properly written as the Lacanian big Other [*Autre*] instead.

[^1]: There is no indication in the story itself what the mysterious
  book the scavenger found among the trash piles is. But the old man
  talks in a way that almost seem to quote directly from Lao Zi himself.

[^2]: Liu Bang and Xiang Yu are also symbolically represented on the
  chessboard by the kings on each side.

[^3]: The common experience of starvation between the two main
  characters, additionally, inspires them to formulate a theory of
  eating, which plays out a dialectic between materialism and idealism.

[^4]: The title is usually translated as "Ferocious Animal[s]," and it
  is unclear if "animal" is singular or plural in Chinese. But
  "动物凶猛" is almost grammatically incorrect, which is better
  preserved in the lopsided translation, "Animal Ferocious."

[^5]: Hangzhou is also characteristically southern. Ning Jing's actress,
  in the film adaptation of the novella, has a southern accent
  noticeably different from the Beijing dialect of everyone around her.
  This perhaps plays into a misogynistic stereotype that southern
  Chinese women are particularly feminine, and that northern Chinese men
  are particularly masculine, thus intensifying the structure of desire.
