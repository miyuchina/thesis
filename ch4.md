"You either have your umbrella or you don't."
=============================================

In the following sections, I will consider four possible ways that
postmodernism might exist in China:

1.  Perhaps it is the same postmodernism as that of the West, but
    geographically restricted to economically advanced metropolitan
    regions;

2.  Or perhaps postmodernism is the same set of formal or generic
    operations, but operating on Chinese-specific cultural content;

3.  Or perhaps taking indigenous culture as content is what Western
    postmodernism does anyways, and what is distinctive about Chinese
    postmodernism is instead its specific socio-historical context;

4.  But once the context shifts, perhaps the cultural form has to change
    as well, which calls for a postmodernism of uneven development.

In each section, I will examine cultural products that might serve as
illustrations or refutations for their respective hypotheses. The goal,
then, is not to prove or disprove the ways in which postmodernism might
exist in China, but rather to show how each conceptual model illuminates
different aspects of the Chinese culture since the 1980s, and how the
object of our investigation shifts as we shift our narrative about it.
Nor does China serve as exemplar of either global postmodernism or its
emancipatory alternative---the two fluctuating polarities that Jameson
has inadvertently fallen into. What I mean to demonstrate, instead, is a
hermeneutic model with which we may understand cultures under the
condition of uneven development. Since uneven development is arguably
the condition intrinsic to global capitalism, this same hermeneutic
model is meant also for the world.

It is not hard to imagine how a metropolitan postmodernism might exist
in China. Arif Dirlik and Zhang Xudong give an apt description of it:
"\[C\]ities such as Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen, now with cityscapes
punctuated by the golden arches of McDonald's and giant Panasonic
advertisements, are nothing more than enclaves of a global consumer
society."[@PM-dirlik-zhang 6] That these cities are "enclaves," bearing
little to no relationship with the rural interior, also means that arts
and media in the coastal cities have tended to develop asynchronously
from the rest of China, resembling mainstream forms of global literature
and art while resonating only weakly with the rural population. This
metropolitan and basically Westernized postmodernism, then, might help
us account for the famous Beijing-based writer 王朔 \[Wang Shuo\], who,
in addition to occupying the top of the bestseller list with his novels
for years on end, is also a prolific screenwriter, often adapting his
own novels into films and TV shows of global acclaim. It has become
routine, especially in Western academia, to associate Wang Shuo's name
with "hooligan literature"---a masculine literature of fast-talking
tough guys and idlers.[^1] The same group of hooligan characters attend
kindergarten together in 看上去很美 *\[Little Red Flowers\]*, high
school in "动物凶猛 \[Animal ferocious\]," and find their middle-aged
selves scattered across China in 玩的就是心跳 *\[Playing for Thrills\]*.
What is not immediately obvious from the term, however, is that Wang
Shuo's "hooliganism" denotes a coming together of two contrasting social
circumstances. On the one hand, the characters of Wang Shuo represent a
new generation of Chinese city dwellers, usually in their twenties and
predominantly men, who can no longer look forward to the stable careers
that the Party offered their predecessors in earlier decades, and who
therefore roam the streets wantonly, coalesce into gangs, or engage in
questionably one-off business ventures. On the other hand, these same
men can typically afford to be jobless because they are the offspring of
high-ranking Party cadres and have therefore inherited considerable
wealth and social status from the revolutionary generation. Wang Shuo's
own identity is important here: his parents were officials in the
Chinese military. The unique political identity of Beijing is also
important, since proximity to the central government means that
second-generation revolutionaries abound in the city. The hooligans,
then, represent a peculiar cross-section of Beijing, a
counter-bourgeoisie of sorts, who construct their identity against what
Maurice Meisner calls the "bureaucratic bourgeoisie"[^2] and the high
cultural elites among them, but who are nevertheless unwilling to be
integrated into a much lower social stratum that occupies the same
space: beggars, prostitutes, blue-collar workers, etc.

Wang Shuo's 1987 novells, "顽主 \[*Wanzhu*\]," has this cast of hooligan
protagonists. The story is about a newly founded company called "3T,"
whose employees get paid to act out roles in their customers' lives: one
plays the husband for a saleswoman on the brink of divorce; another
takes a beating from a depressed, suicidal man; in the novella's set
piece, the hustler-hooligans host a fake award ceremony for an amateur
writer. "T," in the name of the company, is homophonous with the Chinese
character "替 \[*ti*\]," or substitution. "Substitution," then, happens
not only within the plot of the story, when characters substitute for
someone else, but also happens on the level of the text itself, when
pairs of homophones substitute for each other: "T" substituting for
"substitution." The title of the novella, "*Wanzhu*," means in Beijing
slang something like "master of the hooligans," the character "wan"
connoting "wanton" or "frivolous." But this "顽 \[*wan*\]" is also
homophonous with another "玩 \[*wan*\]," which means "play," and thus
the title reads "the master of play." To illustrate that the story does
seem to have the poststructuralist concept of "play" \[*jeu*\] or
"freeplay" in mind,[See @derrida] it is worth examining a section of the
novella, where the language begins to imitate a Joycean modernism. Yang
Zhong, an operator for 3T, is struggling to maintain a conversation with
a customer whom he calls a "modernist woman." After going through
virtually every Western philosopher available to him (neglecting
Nietzsche, with whom he is unfamiliar), Yang turns the topic to Freud:

> "You must really want to marry your mother."
>
> "No no. My father married my mother. I can't marry my mother first
> without having my father marry my mother. Doesn't work."
>
> "I'm not saying you're marrying your mom. Violates social norms.
> Nobody should marry their own mom. Incestuous. I'm saying that you
> want to marry your mom but can't because of your dad unless castrated
> useless because of moral ethics so you're in pain you're attracted to
> no one only want to marry your mom but can't because of your dad how
> am I repeating myself I can't explain it either it's just like this
> anyhow those foreign quote books says looking for a partner is really
> looking for your mom."
>
> "But my mom is blind in one eye."
>
> "If his \[*sic*\] mom is not blind in one eye he won't marry his mom
> to give birth to a younger brother or sister because before he can
> castrate his dad his dad will castrate him because his dad has eight
> buns for one meal and one whole kilogram of pork and works for the
> breeding station castrated tens of thousands of pigs slick with it no
> need for knife squeeze with his hands and the pair of balls comes out
> the Japanese all call him respectfully Talo Testicles."[^3]

It is significant to note that this exchange happens "by an ice cream
stand in a cinema with colored advertisements," and that Yang Zhong
learns about Freud through a "foreign quote book"---reminiscent of the
"Little Red Book" during the Cultural Revolution, whose proper name is
*Chairman Mao's Quote Book*. The same format, in the new era, bears
Freudian doctrines and is sold in mass-market editions as a fashionable
commodity. The most important object of commodification, however, is
Yang's language itself. Humor becomes commodity in the double sense that
Yang is using his wit, albeit increasingly incoherent and running out of
steam, to placate his customer, and that the reader of Wang Shuo's
story, consuming the language, buys into and is captivated by this
parody of modernism. But the unpunctuated torrent of language, in Wang
Shuo, does not function as a stream of consciousness or an interior
monologue, but is instead spoken as dialogue explicitly and
performatively, yielding no insight, contrary to modernism, to the inner
psyche of the characters. Indeed, a lack of insight into what the
characters are thinking and feeling, coupled with such oversaturated
rhetorical flourishes, characterizes most of Wang Shuo's hooligan
novellas. What results from this is a distinct image of this
"counter-bourgeoisie" in Beijing under market reform, psychologically
hollow, repressed or impoverished, all the while bombarded with the
latest commodities---ice creams, films, Freud, language---that a free
market has to offer.

It is not an unreasonable hypothesis, finally, that Wang Shuo's
commercial success depends on a growing readership intimate with the
experience of living in a metropolis, a population that China's economic
growth supplies. His faithfulness to the everyday idiom of Beijing is
also admirably outside of history. The dialogue-driven stories read like
the city's background chatter, such that a present-day reader of Wang
Shuo, visiting Beijing for the first time, can hear the signature rhythm
and cadence of Wang's characters the moment they step out of the train
and climb into the backseat of a taxi. The all-encompassing
commodification within these cities, further, destroys what is left of
an ideological center---the socialism of a failed experiment---in the
linguistic structure, thus making the freeplay of all signifiers
possible.

The culmination of Wang Shuo's hooligan literature is 玩的就是心跳
*\[Playing for Thrills\]*, a full-length novel he published in 1987. The
book is an even more recognizable version of postmodernism. Wang Shuo
himself notes that the novel is inspired by *Rue des Boutiques Obscures*
, a novel by the French postmodernist Patrick Modiano.[^4] "Play,"
again, is in the title. The "thrills," meanwhile, come from the fact
that the novel, like Modiano's original, is a work of crime fiction: the
first-person narrator of "*Wanzhu*," Fang Yan, finds himself the main
suspect for a murder mystery that happened a decade ago, and wanders
around Beijing talking to his old friends or chasing faded photographs,
so that he may conduct his own investigation and prove his innocence.
The hooligan clan now confronts real stakes: the police have found a
headless corpse, and whoever committed the murder is going to jail for
the rest of their life; the protagonist, however, is amnesiac, and
cannot remember what he was doing when the murder happened; the
enigmatic days when his memory fails him, then, become a rupture in the
narrative of his personal history, a hole in his otherwise stable
identity. Finding out what really happened, both for resolving the
murder case and for mending Fang Yan's identity construction, becomes
rather urgent.

But "what really happened" is itself nebulous within the freeplay of
signifiers. In the first chapter, Fang Yan mistakenly thinks that his
gambling friends are still in his apartment, and decides to pull a prank
on them by announcing the arrival of the police:

> I clomped upstairs and flung open the door. "Cops!" I shouted. "The
> cops are here. Drop everything and don't move!"
>
> "We're not moving. Come on in."
>
> Three men in civilian blue overcoats sat around the table. They looked
> friendly enough. "You're Fang Yan, right?" one of them asked. "We
> thought you'd never show up." He introduced himself and his companions
> as policemen.
>
> "How come you're shaking? No need for that."
>
> I said I wasn't, and if I was, it was because I was wired, not
> scared.[^5]

Fang Yan's joke about the cops, then, is somehow actualized into truth:
the police are in Fang Yan's apartment to investigate his connection
with the murder case. But the readers need to be convinced that the
scene is actually happening: we certainly do not believe Fang Yan's
exclamation, "The cops are here!"; the reply he receives, "We're not
moving," could still be the response of his fellow gamblers; the
visitors, in any case, are only wearing "civilian blue overcoats," not
police uniforms; the narrator, cigarette-addled and absentminded as he
is, does not say that the visitors are policemen, but rather that
"\[h\]e introduced himself and his companions as policemen"---they
could, in a novel filled with identity shifts and cover stories, still
be playing games. What assures the readers that this encounter is not a
game---that we are experiencing the effects of the real---is an
unconscious symptom, introduced by an unattributed line of dialogue:
"How come you're shaking?" Fang Yan, in other words, does not notice the
symptom himself. When the lead policeman points it out, his response is
an immediate repression: "I said I wasn't." We then immediately return
to the realm of indeterminate freeplay, as Fang Yan regains his wits and
resumes his roguish ways: "It was because I was wired, not scared." The
readers are never told what Fang Yan is so scared of. The private
gambling party is no substantial crime, and we later learn that the rest
of the gambling circle are simply shooed out of the apartment, not
arrested. Perhaps Fang Yan is guilty of something in his past, but even
he does not know what he should be guilty of at this point in the story,
since he still does not remember anything surrounding the murder. The
symptomatic return of the real, then, only happens for a brief moment;
the rhapsodic display of hooligan ingenuity forms the unbroken surface
of this postmodern text.

A discussion of *Playing for Thrills* as Western-style postmodernism
cannot be complete without considering Wang Shuo's memorable
descriptions of architecture. Here, however, the readers are reminded
that perhaps the novel cannot be considered as a self-same image of
Western postmodernism. A scene set in a restaurant near the southern
coast is particularly central to the novel, since it is the last place
Fang Yan remembers seeing the victim of the murder:

> From the outside it looked like a great big garage, with a heavy
> wooden signboard---black letters on a gold background---over the
> entrance. By standing next to the concrete utility pole near the
> entrance we could see down several lanes laid out like spokes; at the
> end of a couple of them were streets wide enough for pedestrian and
> vehicular traffic. As many as a hundred metal tables with spotty green
> paint were arranged throughout the courtyard, which was surrounded by
> massive two-story colonial-type buildings, replete with etched
> concrete pillars, intricately carved banisters, and arched window. The
> stone facing had turned black under the assault of wind, rain, smoke,
> and grease. The restaurant itself was in an old-fashioned Chinese
> building, with carved beams and painted rafters and flying eaves and
> shuttered windows that boasted the handiwork of master woodcarvers:
> Flowers, birds, insects, and all manner of flora made the building
> look like a multitiered stage. I might be wrong, but I think it was
> deserted: no diners *and* no waiters.[@WS 9/11]

A restaurant with "no diners *and* no waiters" is certainly not a
restaurant, but a space of postmodernism. Later in the novel, as Fang
Yan tries to reconstruct the participants of this last meal, the space
would indeed transform into "a multitiered stage," where characters take
up shifting chairs around the table and exchange meaningful but
indecipherable conversations, inferred or imagined by the protagonist.
In the various dreamscapes of Fan Yan, the restaurant becomes
increasingly labyrinthian, which reminds one of Jameson's directionless
adventures in the Bonaventure Hotel. But if Wang Shuo's nameless
restaurant is Jameson's Bonaventure Hotel, we should also note that one
is in China, and the other the United States: "The restaurant itself was
in an old-fashioned Chinese building," adorned with Chinese traditional
decorations. It is significant, indeed, that Wang Shuo's description
seems to ask its readers to peel back the layers of architectural
camouflage and discover a Chinese kernel within a Western shell: a few
blocks away are "streets wide enough for pedestrian and vehicular
traffic"---a fully modernized roadway; the outside looks like "a great
big garage"; the courtyard, furthermore, is "surrounded by massive
two-story colonial-type buildings." *Playing for Thrills*, in this
sense, asks its readers not to consider it as an example of
Western-style, metropolitan postmodernism, but instead to look for
Chinese-specific contents enclosed within. How, then, might we
understand this postmodernism, which takes Chinese cultural forms as its
content?
